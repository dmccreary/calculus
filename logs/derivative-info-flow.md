- Notes: Successfully generated the Derivative Information Flow Chart MicroSim. This interactive infographic shows how information flows from f'' (second derivative) to f' (first derivative) to f (original function), helping students understand the chain of logical implications between derivatives. Features include:
  - Three connected boxes with color-coded properties
  - Click-to-highlight implications across boxes
  - Hover tooltips on arrows explaining relationships
  - "Trace Example" button that walks through three scenarios (Positive Chain, Negative Chain, Zero Crossing Chain)
  - Reset button to clear all highlights
  - Responsive design for embedding in various container sizes
