Notes: Generated complete trig-derivative-cycle MicroSim with:
- Circular diagram showing sin -> cos -> -sin -> -cos -> sin cycle
- Dual graphs showing f(x) and f'(x)
- "Take Derivative" button to advance through the cycle
- "Reset" button to return to sin(x)
- Canvas-based checkbox for "Show Both Graphs" toggle
- Color-coded functions matching diagram and graphs
- Responsive width design following MicroSim standards
- Added to mkdocs.yml navigation
- Files created:
  - docs/sims/trig-derivative-cycle/trig-derivative-cycle.js
  - docs/sims/trig-derivative-cycle/main.html
  - docs/sims/trig-derivative-cycle/index.md
  - docs/sims/trig-derivative-cycle/metadata.json
