- Notes: Generated Concavity Explorer MicroSim with p5.js. Features include draggable point on function curve with tangent line, color-coded concavity regions (blue for concave up, orange for concave down), synchronized second derivative graph below, annotation panel showing current values and concavity status. Includes dropdown for 4 function choices (cubic, sine, quartic, Gaussian) and toggle buttons for f''(x) graph visibility and slope values display. Added Delta Moment quote for narrative anchor. Updated mkdocs.yml navigation in alphabetical order.
