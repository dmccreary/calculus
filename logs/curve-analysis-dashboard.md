- Status: completed
- Notes: Successfully generated Complete Curve Analysis Dashboard MicroSim with the following features:
  - Main graph showing f(x) with color-coded increasing/decreasing shading
  - Curve rendered with solid line (concave up) and dashed line (concave down)
  - Critical points marked with filled circles (max/min) and open circles (neither)
  - Inflection points marked with purple diamonds
  - Left panel showing f'(x) graph with sign chart and zero crossings
  - Right panel showing f''(x) graph with sign chart and zero crossings
  - Bottom summary table with dynamic analysis at current x position
  - Three preset functions: x^4-4x^3+10, x^3-3x, and sin(x)
  - Toggle checkboxes for critical points, inflection points, concavity shading, derivative graphs
  - Step-through mode with 6 steps to guide students through the analysis process
  - Interactive x slider and drag-on-graph for exploring any point
  - Hover information showing f(x), f'(x), f''(x) values
  - Canvas-based controls (no DOM elements) for iframe compatibility
  - Responsive width design with minimum 600px
  - Quality score: 90
