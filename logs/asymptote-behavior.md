- Status: completed
- Notes:
  - Successfully created the Asymptote Behavior Visualization MicroSim
  - Uses canvas-based controls per project requirements (no DOM elements like createButton/createSlider)
  - Features Delta robot character that travels along the curve
  - Three example functions: 1/x, (2x^2+1)/(x^2-4), and (x^2-1)/(x-1) with hole
  - Color-coded curve (red near vertical asymptotes, blue near horizontal asymptote)
  - Toggle for showing/hiding asymptote lines
  - Info panel shows real-time x, y coordinates and proximity warnings
  - Added to mkdocs.yml navigation alphabetically between Asymptote Analyzer and Asymptote Types
  - Files created:
