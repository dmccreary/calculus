# Session Log: Create Course Description

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Project:** calculus
**Task:** Create AP Calculus course description with Bloom's Taxonomy learning objectives

---

## Request

Create a detailed course description for a calculus course covering US College Board AP Calculus topics, with learning objectives for each of the 6 levels of Bloom's Taxonomy (2001 revision).

## Actions Taken

1. **Explored existing project structure**
   - Found existing docs: `about.md`, `license.md`, `college-credit.md`
   - Reviewed `about.md` to understand project context (intelligent textbook with MicroSimulations)
   - Reviewed `college-credit.md` to understand alignment goals with AP Calculus standards

2. **Created comprehensive course description**
   - File: `docs/course-description.md`
   - Aligned with College Board AP Calculus AB and BC curriculum

## File Created

`docs/course-description.md` - 604 lines

### Structure

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Course Overview | Purpose, target audience, prerequisites |
| Course Structure | 10 units with detailed topic breakdowns |
| Learning Objectives | 160 objectives across 6 Bloom levels |
| Assessment Alignment | AP AB/BC exam coverage |
| Course Features | MicroSims, multiple representations, applications |

### Units Covered

| Unit | Title | Scope |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Limits and Continuity | AB/BC |
| 2 | Differentiation: Definition and Fundamental Properties | AB/BC |
| 3 | Differentiation: Composite, Implicit, and Inverse Functions | AB/BC |
| 4 | Contextual Applications of Differentiation | AB/BC |
| 5 | Analytical Applications of Differentiation | AB/BC |
| 6 | Integration and Accumulation of Change | AB/BC |
| 7 | Differential Equations | AB/BC (some BC-only) |
| 8 | Applications of Integration | AB/BC (some BC-only) |
| 9 | Parametric, Polar, and Vector Functions | BC only |
| 10 | Infinite Sequences and Series | BC only |

### Learning Objectives by Bloom's Taxonomy Level

| Level | Category | Count | Description |
|-------|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Remember | 25 | Recall definitions, formulas, theorems |
| 2 | Understand | 32 | Explain, interpret, describe relationships |
| 3 | Apply | 35 | Calculate, solve, use procedures |
| 4 | Analyze | 29 | Compare, distinguish, investigate connections |
| 5 | Evaluate | 19 | Assess, judge, critique methods and solutions |
| 6 | Create | 20 | Design problems, construct models, synthesize |

**Total Learning Objectives:** 160

### Key Topics per Unit

**Unit 1 - Limits:** 13 topics including limit definition, continuity, IVT, asymptotes

**Unit 2 - Derivatives:** 10 topics including power/product/quotient rules, trig derivatives

**Unit 3 - Advanced Derivatives:** 6 topics including chain rule, implicit differentiation, inverse functions

**Unit 4 - Derivative Applications:** 7 topics including related rates, L'Hospital's Rule, linear approximation

**Unit 5 - Analytical Applications:** 12 topics including MVT, optimization, curve sketching

**Unit 6 - Integration:** 11 topics including Riemann sums, FTC, u-substitution

**Unit 7 - Differential Equations:** 9 topics including slope fields, separation of variables, exponential/logistic models

**Unit 8 - Integration Applications:** 13 topics including area, volume (disc/washer/cross-section), arc length

**Unit 9 - Parametric/Polar/Vectors (BC):** 9 topics including parametric derivatives, polar area, vector motion

**Unit 10 - Series (BC):** 15 topics including convergence tests, Taylor/Maclaurin series, error bounds

## Standards Alignment

- **Primary:** College Board AP Calculus Course and Exam Description
- **Secondary:** MAA recommendations, Common Core mathematical practices
- **Credit Equivalency:**
  - AB = Calculus I (3-4 credits)
  - BC = Calculus I + II (6-8 credits)

## Notes

- File was modified by user/linter after creation (formatting adjustments to list indentation)
- Course description emphasizes interactive MicroSimulations as key differentiator
- Learning objectives numbered for easy reference (e.g., LO 1.1, LO 2.5)
- BC-only content clearly marked throughout

## Session Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive AP Calculus course description with:
- Complete topic coverage for both AB and BC exams
- 160 learning objectives distributed across all 6 Bloom's Taxonomy levels
- Clear prerequisite and target audience information
- Assessment alignment documentation
- Emphasis on interactive learning through MicroSimulations
