- Notes: Generated Fencing Problem Optimizer MicroSim for Chapter 19 (Optimization). Created all required files (fencing-optimizer.js, main.html, index.md, metadata.json) with canvas-based controls following project conventions. Added to mkdocs.yml navigation in alphabetical order. MicroSim features bird's eye view of rectangular field next to river, graph of A(x) = x(F-x)/2, interactive slider for x value, adjustable fencing constraint, Explore/Solve mode toggle, and Show Solution button. The MicroSim demonstrates the classic optimization problem of maximizing area with one side along a river at Bloom Level Apply (L3).
