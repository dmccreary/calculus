## Files Created
- index.md - MkDocs page with iframe embedding and comprehensive lesson plan
- main.html - Standalone HTML file for the MicroSim
- script.js - p5.js implementation with canvas-based controls
- metadata.json - Dublin Core metadata for faceted search

## Features Implemented
- Six cards showing all basic trig integrals arranged in pairs
- Color coding: blue for positive results, red for negative results
- Hover tooltips displaying memory aids for each integral
- Show Verification toggle to display derivative checks
- Quiz mode with typed input and score tracking
- Show All / Hide All buttons
- Visual emphasis on derivative-integral relationship
- Responsive canvas sizing

## Notes
This MicroSim complements the existing trig-derivatives-card MicroSim by showing the reverse relationship. The integrals are the derivatives read backwards, which is emphasized through the verification feature.
