  - Four function options (quadratic, cubic, sine, square root)
  - Draggable point c on the curve
  - Sliders for adjusting interval endpoints a and b
  - Blue dashed secant line connecting endpoints
  - Orange solid tangent line at point c
  - Real-time slope calculations displayed in info panel
  - Green indicator when MVT is satisfied (slopes match)
  - Auto-find c button with animation
  - Toggle to show/hide secant line
  - Canvas-based controls following project guidelines
  - Width-responsive design
