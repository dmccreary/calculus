- Notes: Successfully generated Critical Point Finder MicroSim with dual graph display (f(x) and f'(x)), step-by-step solution panel, canvas-based controls including dropdown for function type selection, toggle for derivative graph visibility, zoom slider, and navigation buttons. Includes polynomial, absolute value, rational, and piecewise function examples demonstrating both f'(x)=0 and f'(x) DNE critical points. Added to mkdocs.yml navigation.
