- Notes: Created Bloom Level 6 (Create) MicroSim for students to construct function graphs from derivative information. Includes 4 problem types (local maximum, two extrema, inflection point, S-curve), canvas-based drawing tools with smooth curve generation, automatic sketch evaluation with pass/fail feedback on each condition, progressive hint system (points, tangent lines, directional arrows), solution overlay toggle, and responsive design. All controls are canvas-based per CLAUDE.md requirements.
