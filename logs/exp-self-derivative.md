Status: success
Notes:
- Created interactive p5.js MicroSim demonstrating that e^x is its own derivative
- Bloom Level: Understand (L2) with verbs explain, interpret, demonstrate
- Instructional design focuses on concrete data visibility (showing numerical equality between y-value and slope)
- Features: x-slider (-3 to 3), tangent line toggle, "Compare y and slope" button with visual highlighting
- Info panel shows y = e^x and slope values side-by-side, emphasizing they always match
- Includes Delta Moment quote: "My height IS my slope!"
- Canvas dimensions: 400x480 (drawHeight=400, controlHeight=80)
- iframe height: 482px
- Added to mkdocs.yml navigation under MicroSims section
- Files created:
  - /docs/sims/exp-self-derivative/exp-self-derivative.js
  - /docs/sims/exp-self-derivative/main.html
  - /docs/sims/exp-self-derivative/index.md
  - /docs/sims/exp-self-derivative/metadata.json
