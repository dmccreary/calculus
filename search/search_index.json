The robot has an equilateral triangle-shaped body made of smooth teal/turquoise metal (hex #009688) with rounded corners for a friendly appearance. The triangle is oriented with one vertex pointing upward like the Greek letter delta (\u0394).  Near the top vertex (apex), Delta has two large, expressive circular LED eyes that glow warm orange (#FF5722), giving her a curious and enthusiastic expression. The eyes are slightly different sizes, with the larger one raised as if asking a question.  At the two bottom vertices of the triangle, small rubber-treaded wheels are attached, allowing Delta to roll along mathematical curves. The wheels are dark gray with visible treads.  Along the left edge of the triangle body, a glowing green LED strip (#00E676) acts as a \"slope indicator\" that shows the steepness of whatever surface Delta is on.  Delta has small retractable measuring arms on each side - thin metallic appendages with small grabber claws, currently folded against the body.  Next to Delta's is a backpack with the name \"integral journal\" where she stores accumulated data.  At the very top of the apex, a thin flexible antenna with a small glowing orange ball at the tip wobbles playfully.  The robot has a slightly tilted pose (about 5-10 degrees), as if standing on a slope, which reinforces her connection to derivatives and slopes.  Background: Delta is positioned on a stylized mathematical landscape - a smooth 3D curve that looks like rolling hills, rendered in soft purple and blue gradients. Grid lines subtly suggest a coordinate system. The scene has warm, inviting lighting.  Style: Modern 3D render with soft lighting, slightly cartoonish proportions for approachability, suitable for an educational textbook. Clean, professional, and appealing to high school students. Similar aesthetic to Pixar or educational app mascots.   <p>Delta Says</p> <p>\"Hey there! I'm Delta\u2014a curious little triangular robot who lives for exploring mathematical landscapes.

This interactive MicroSim lets you practice building sign charts for derivatives, helping you identify where functions increase and decrease.</p> <p>Delta Moment</p> <p>\"Building a sign chart is like making a map of my journey! First I find the spots where I'm perfectly level (critical points), then I figure out which direction I'm tilted in each section. Plus signs mean I'm climbing, minus signs mean I'm descending. With this map, I know exactly what the landscape looks like before I even start rolling!\"</p>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#how-to-use","title":"How to Use","text":"<ol> <li>Choose a function by clicking f1, f2, f3, f4, or f5 in the control area</li> <li>Place critical points by double-clicking on the number line where you think f'(x) = 0</li> <li>Determine signs by clicking on each interval to cycle through +, -, or blank</li> <li>Add test points (optional) by right-clicking in an interval to see the actual derivative value</li> <li>Check your work by clicking \"Check My Work\" to see the correct answer</li> <li>Toggle the graph to show or hide the function curve with color-coded regions</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#visual-feedback","title":"Visual Feedback","text":"<ul> <li>Green regions: Where the derivative is positive (function increasing)</li> <li>Red regions: Where the derivative is negative (function decreasing)</li> <li>Yellow dots: Critical points on the graph where the derivative equals zero</li> <li>Arrows: Test point indicators showing whether f'(x) is positive or negative</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#iframe-embedding","title":"Iframe Embedding","text":"<p>Copy this iframe to embed the MicroSim in your website:</p> <pre><code>&lt;iframe src=\"https://dmccreary.github.io/calculus/sims/sign-chart-builder/main.html\" height=\"582px\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#learning-objectives","title":"Learning Objectives","text":"<p>After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:</p> <ol> <li>Identify critical points of a function where f'(x) = 0</li> <li>Construct a sign chart showing the sign of f'(x) in each interval</li> <li>Determine intervals where a function is increasing (f'(x) &gt; 0) or decreasing (f'(x) &lt; 0)</li> <li>Connect the sign chart to the graphical behavior of the original function</li> <li>Verify sign determinations using test point evaluation</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#mathematical-background","title":"Mathematical Background","text":"<p>A sign chart for f'(x) organizes information about where a function increases and decreases:</p> <ol> <li>Find critical points: Solve f'(x) = 0 to find x-values where the derivative is zero</li> <li>Divide the domain: Critical points split the number line into intervals</li> <li>Test each interval: Choose a test point in each interval and evaluate f'(x)</li> <li>Determine behavior:</li> <li>If f'(x) &gt; 0 on an interval, f is increasing on that interval</li> <li>If f'(x) &lt; 0 on an interval, f is decreasing on that interval</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#example-fx-x3-3x","title":"Example: f(x) = x^3 - 3x","text":"<p>Step 1: Find f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3</p> <p>Step 2: Solve f'(x) = 0: \\(\\(3x^2 - 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm 1\\)\\)</p> <p>Step 3: Create sign chart with critical points at x = -1 and x = 1</p> Interval Test Point f'(test) Sign Behavior (-oo, -1) x = -2 3(4) - 3 = 9 + Increasing (-1, 1) x = 0 3(0) - 3 = -3 - Decreasing (1, +oo) x = 2 3(4) - 3 = 9 + Increasing <p>Conclusion: f increases on (-oo, -1), decreases on (-1, 1), and increases on (1, +oo).</p>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#functions-in-this-microsim","title":"Functions in This MicroSim","text":"Button Function Derivative Critical Points f1 f(x) = x^3 - 3x f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3 x = -1, 1 f2 f(x) = x^2 - 4 f'(x) = 2x x = 0 f3 f(x) = x^3 - 12x f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12 x = -2, 2 f4 f(x) = x^4 - 8x^2 f'(x) = 4x^3 - 16x x = -2, 0, 2 f5 f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 3 f'(x) = -2x + 2 x = 1"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#lesson-plan","title":"Lesson Plan","text":""},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#grade-level","title":"Grade Level","text":"<p>High School (Grades 11-12) or Early College (Calculus I)</p>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#duration","title":"Duration","text":"<p>20-30 minutes for complete exploration</p>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<ul> <li>Understanding of derivatives and their meaning</li> <li>Knowledge that derivatives indicate slope/rate of change</li> <li>Familiarity with solving equations for zeros</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#warm-up-questions-5-minutes","title":"Warm-Up Questions (5 minutes)","text":"<ol> <li>If a car's velocity is positive, what direction is it moving?</li> <li>At the very top of a roller coaster hill, what is the derivative of the position function?</li> <li>If f'(x) &gt; 0 for all x in an interval, what can you say about f on that interval?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sims/sign-chart-builder/#guided-exploration-15-minutes","title":"Guided Exploration (15 minutes)","text":"<p>Part 1: Understanding the Connection 1.
