The robot has an equilateral triangle-shaped body made of smooth teal/turquoise metal (hex #009688) with rounded corners for a friendly appearance. The triangle is oriented with one vertex pointing upward like the Greek letter delta (\u0394).  Near the top vertex (apex), Delta has two large, expressive circular LED eyes that glow warm orange (#FF5722), giving her a curious and enthusiastic expression. The eyes are slightly different sizes, with the larger one raised as if asking a question.  At the two bottom vertices of the triangle, small rubber-treaded wheels are attached, allowing Delta to roll along mathematical curves. The wheels are dark gray with visible treads.  Along the left edge of the triangle body, a glowing green LED strip (#00E676) acts as a \"slope indicator\" that shows the steepness of whatever surface Delta is on.  Delta has small retractable measuring arms on each side - thin metallic appendages with small grabber claws, currently folded against the body.  Next to Delta's is a backpack with the name \"integral journal\" where she stores accumulated data.  At the very top of the apex, a thin flexible antenna with a small glowing orange ball at the tip wobbles playfully.  The robot has a slightly tilted pose (about 5-10 degrees), as if standing on a slope, which reinforces her connection to derivatives and slopes.  Background: Delta is positioned on a stylized mathematical landscape - a smooth 3D curve that looks like rolling hills, rendered in soft purple and blue gradients. Grid lines subtly suggest a coordinate system. The scene has warm, inviting lighting.  Style: Modern 3D render with soft lighting, slightly cartoonish proportions for approachability, suitable for an educational textbook. Clean, professional, and appealing to high school students. Similar aesthetic to Pixar or educational app mascots.   <p>Delta Says</p> <p>\"Hey there! I'm Delta\u2014a curious little triangular robot who lives for exploring mathematical landscapes.
