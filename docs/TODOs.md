# Claude Code Tasks to be done

1. Go through all the questions and make SURE that they are formatted consistent with the new
backslash delimiters, not the dollar signs.

2. Run the reference generator and put references in a "references.md" file in each chapter.
Note that these tasks can run in parallel

3. Figure out if the watcher is working consistently when we do a mkdocs build

4. Fix the existing microsims that have title, subtitle and the y-axis label overlaps at the top of the p5.js drawing regions.

4. Update the microsim generator skill to make sure that the title, subtitle and the y-axis label
at the top of the graphs do not overlap.  Make the drawing regions larger to accommodate this.
Ask claude how we could add rules to the microsim generator to prevent this.
