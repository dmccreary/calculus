Test your understanding of higher-order derivatives and motion with these review questions.

#### 1. The second derivative f''(x) represents:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The slope of f(x)
2. The rate of change of the rate of change
3. The area under f(x)
4. The average rate of change
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The second derivative is the derivative of the derivative, representing how the rate of change itself is changing. In physics, this corresponds to acceleration.

    **Concept Tested:** Second Derivative

#### 2. If position is s(t), then velocity v(t) equals:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. s''(t)
2. s'(t)
3. ∫s(t)dt
4. s(t)/t
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Velocity is the derivative of position: v(t) = s'(t). This gives the instantaneous rate of change of position with respect to time.

    **Concept Tested:** Velocity from Position

#### 3. Acceleration a(t) is defined as:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The first derivative of position
2. The second derivative of position (or first derivative of velocity)
3. The integral of position
4. Position divided by time squared
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Acceleration is the derivative of velocity, which makes it the second derivative of position: a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t).

    **Concept Tested:** Acceleration

#### 4. If s(t) = t³ − 6t², what is the acceleration at t = 2?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. −12
2. 0
3. 6
4. 12
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. First, v(t) = s'(t) = 3t² − 12t. Then a(t) = v'(t) = 6t − 12. At t = 2: a(2) = 6(2) − 12 = 0.

    **Concept Tested:** Position Velocity Acceleration

#### 5. The third derivative is sometimes called:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Snap
2. Crackle
3. Jerk
4. Pop
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The third derivative of position (derivative of acceleration) is called jerk. It measures how quickly acceleration is changing.

    **Concept Tested:** Jerk

#### 6. What is the difference between speed and velocity?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They are the same thing
2. Speed is the absolute value of velocity
3. Velocity is the absolute value of speed
4. Speed is the derivative of velocity
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Speed is the magnitude (absolute value) of velocity: speed = |v(t)|. Velocity can be positive or negative (indicating direction), but speed is always non-negative.

    **Concept Tested:** Speed vs Velocity

---

#### 7. An object is speeding up when:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Velocity is positive
2. Acceleration is positive
3. Velocity and acceleration have the same sign
4. Velocity and acceleration have opposite signs
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. An object speeds up when velocity and acceleration have the same sign (both positive or both negative). When they have opposite signs, the object is slowing down.

    **Concept Tested:** Speeding Up Slowing Down

#### 8. If f(x) = sin(x), what is f'''(x)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. sin(x)
2. cos(x)
3. −sin(x)
4. −cos(x)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Starting with sin(x): f'(x) = cos(x), f''(x) = −sin(x), f'''(x) = −cos(x). The pattern continues with period 4.

    **Concept Tested:** Higher Trig Derivatives

#### 9. The notation d²y/dx² represents:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. (dy/dx)²
2. The second derivative
3. d(y²)/dx
4. Twice the first derivative
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The notation d²y/dx² is Leibniz notation for the second derivative. It means d/dx(dy/dx), the derivative of the derivative.

    **Concept Tested:** Second Derivative Notation

#### 10. A particle moves along a line with position s(t) = t⁴ − 4t³. When is the particle at rest?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. t = 0 only
2. t = 3 only
3. t = 0 and t = 3
4. t = 0, t = 1, and t = 3
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. At rest means velocity = 0. v(t) = s'(t) = 4t³ − 12t² = 4t²(t − 3). Setting v(t) = 0: t = 0 or t = 3.

    **Concept Tested:** Direction of Motion
