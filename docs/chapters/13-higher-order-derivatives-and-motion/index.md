# Higher-Order Derivatives and Motion

## Summary

This chapter explores second and higher-order derivatives and their applications to motion. Students will learn notation for higher derivatives, understand the physical interpretations of velocity, acceleration, and jerk, and analyze motion problems. The chapter emphasizes the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration functions, including determining when an object is speeding up or slowing down. After completing this chapter, students will be able to solve straight-line motion problems using derivatives.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Higher-Order Derivative
2. Second Derivative
3. Third Derivative
4. nth Derivative
5. Second Deriv Notation
6. f Double Prime
7. d2y dx2 Notation
8. Velocity from Position
9. Acceleration
10. Jerk
11. Position Velocity Accel
12. Speed vs Velocity
13. Direction of Motion
14. Speeding Up Slowing
15. Higher Trig Derivatives
