# Understanding Limits

## Summary

This chapter introduces the fundamental concept of limits, which forms the cornerstone of calculus. Students will develop an intuitive understanding of what it means for a function to approach a value, learn proper limit notation, and explore one-sided and two-sided limits. The chapter also covers the essential limit laws that allow for algebraic manipulation of limits. After completing this chapter, students will be able to evaluate basic limits and understand when limits exist or fail to exist.
