# Transcendental Integrals

## Summary

This chapter extends integration to transcendental functions. Students will learn the integrals of all six trigonometric functions, exponential functions (both e^x and a^x), and the natural logarithm integral arising from 1/x. The chapter also covers integrals that produce inverse trigonometric functions, including arcsin, arctan, and arcsec forms. After completing this chapter, students will have a complete toolkit of basic antiderivative formulas for AP Calculus.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Integral of Sin x
2. Integral of Cos x
3. Integral of Sec Squared
4. Integral of Csc Squared
5. Integral of Sec Tan
6. Integral of Csc Cot
7. Integral of e to x
8. Integral of a to x
9. Integral of 1 Over x
10. Natural Log Integral
11. Inverse Trig Integrals
12. Arcsin Integral
13. Arctan Integral
14. Arcsec Integral
