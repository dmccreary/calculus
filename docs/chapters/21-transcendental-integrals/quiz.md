#### 1. What is ∫eˣ dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. xeˣ + C
2. eˣ + C
3. eˣ/x + C
4. eˣ⁻¹ + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since d/dx[eˣ] = eˣ, the antiderivative of eˣ is itself: ∫eˣ dx = eˣ + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Integral of e to x

#### 2. What is ∫1/x dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x⁻¹ + C
2. ln(x) + C
3. ln|x| + C
4. −1/x² + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C. The absolute value is needed because ln is only defined for positive arguments, but 1/x is defined for x ≠ 0.

    **Concept Tested:** Integral of 1 Over x

#### 3. What is ∫2ˣ dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 2ˣ + C
2. 2ˣ/ln(2) + C
3. x·2ˣ⁻¹ + C
4. 2ˣ·ln(2) + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. For ∫aˣ dx = aˣ/ln(a) + C. So ∫2ˣ dx = 2ˣ/ln(2) + C. This comes from the fact that d/dx[aˣ] = aˣ·ln(a).

    **Concept Tested:** Integral of a to x

#### 4. What is ∫1/(1 + x²) dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. ln(1 + x²) + C
2. arctan(x) + C
3. arcsin(x) + C
4. 1/2 · ln(1 + x²) + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since d/dx[arctan(x)] = 1/(1 + x²), we have ∫1/(1 + x²) dx = arctan(x) + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Arctan Integral

---

#### 5. What is ∫1/√(1 − x²) dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. arctan(x) + C
2. arcsin(x) + C
3. arccos(x) + C
4. ln|x| + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since d/dx[arcsin(x)] = 1/√(1 − x²), we have ∫1/√(1 − x²) dx = arcsin(x) + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Arcsin Integral

---

#### 6. What is ∫sec(x)tan(x) dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. sec(x) + C
2. tan(x) + C
3. sec²(x) + C
4. −sec(x) + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Since d/dx[sec(x)] = sec(x)tan(x), the antiderivative of sec(x)tan(x) is sec(x) + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Integral of Sec Tan

---

#### 7. What is ∫csc²(x) dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. cot(x) + C
2. −cot(x) + C
3. csc(x) + C
4. −csc(x)cot(x) + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since d/dx[−cot(x)] = csc²(x), we have ∫csc²(x) dx = −cot(x) + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Integral of Csc Squared

---

#### 8. What is ∫e^(3x) dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. e^(3x) + C
2. 3e^(3x) + C
3. e^(3x)/3 + C
4. e^(3x+1) + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Using substitution (or recognizing the pattern): ∫e^(3x) dx = e^(3x)/3 + C. Check: d/dx[e^(3x)/3] = e^(3x).

    **Concept Tested:** Integral of e to x

---

#### 9. The integral ∫1/x dx = ln|x| + C uses absolute value because:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It makes the answer positive
2. ln is only defined for positive numbers, but 1/x is defined for x ≠ 0
3. It's a convention that doesn't matter
4. The derivative requires it
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The function 1/x is defined for all x ≠ 0, but ln(x) is only defined for x > 0. Using |x| extends the antiderivative to negative x values.

    **Concept Tested:** Natural Log Integral

---

#### 10. What is ∫csc(x)cot(x) dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. csc(x) + C
2. −csc(x) + C
3. cot(x) + C
4. −cot(x) + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since d/dx[−csc(x)] = csc(x)cot(x), we have ∫csc(x)cot(x) dx = −csc(x) + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Integral of Csc Cot
