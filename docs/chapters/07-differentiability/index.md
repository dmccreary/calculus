# Differentiability

## Summary

This chapter explores when and where functions are differentiable. Students will learn the conditions for differentiability at a point, understand why corners, cusps, and vertical tangents prevent differentiability, and discover the important relationship between differentiability and continuity. The chapter also covers techniques for estimating derivatives from graphs and tables. After completing this chapter, students will be able to determine where functions are differentiable and use local linearity for approximation.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Differentiability
2. Differentiability Point
3. One-Sided Derivative
4. Non-Differentiable Pts
5. Corner Point
6. Cusp
7. Vertical Tangent Point
8. Derivative from Graph
9. Derivative from Table
10. Symmetric Difference
11. Diff Implies Continuous
12. Continuous Not Implies
13. Local Linearity
14. Tangent Approximation
15. Instantaneous Velocity

## Prerequisites
