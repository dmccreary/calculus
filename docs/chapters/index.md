## How to Use This Textbook

This textbook is designed with concept dependencies in mind. Each chapter builds on concepts from previous chapters, so it's recommended to progress through the chapters in order. Foundation concepts in early chapters are prerequisites for understanding more advanced topics later.

The learning graph ensures that you won't encounter a concept before mastering its prerequisites. If you're reviewing specific topics, check the prerequisites section of each chapter to ensure you have the necessary background.

**Note:** Each chapter includes a list of concepts covered. Make sure to complete prerequisites before moving to advanced chapters.
