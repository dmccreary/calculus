# L'Hospital's Rule and Contextual Applications

## Summary

This chapter covers L'Hospital's Rule for evaluating indeterminate forms and interpreting derivatives in real-world contexts. Students will learn to apply L'Hospital's Rule to 0/0 and infinity/infinity forms, as well as convert other indeterminate forms (0·∞, 1^∞, etc.) to apply the rule. The chapter also emphasizes understanding derivative units and interpreting rates of change in economics, biology, and physics contexts. After completing this chapter, students will be able to evaluate complex limits and explain what derivatives mean in applications.
