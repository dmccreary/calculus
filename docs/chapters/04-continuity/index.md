# Continuity

## Summary

This chapter explores the concept of continuity, which describes functions that have no breaks, holes, or jumps in their graphs. Students will learn the three conditions required for continuity at a point, distinguish between different types of discontinuities (removable, jump, and infinite), and understand how to determine continuity for various function types. The chapter culminates with the Intermediate Value Theorem, a powerful result about continuous functions. After completing this chapter, students will be able to analyze function continuity and apply the IVT to prove the existence of roots.
