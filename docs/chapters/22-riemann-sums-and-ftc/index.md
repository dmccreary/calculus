# Riemann Sums and the Fundamental Theorem

## Summary

This chapter develops the definite integral through Riemann sums and presents the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which connects differentiation and integration. Students will learn left, right, midpoint, and trapezoidal approximations, then understand the definite integral as the limit of Riemann sums. Both parts of the FTC are covered: Part 1 shows that the derivative of an accumulation function is the integrand, and Part 2 provides the evaluation theorem for computing definite integrals. After completing this chapter, students will understand the deep connection between derivatives and integrals.
