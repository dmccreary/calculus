# Evaluating Limits

## Summary

This chapter develops techniques for evaluating limits that cannot be solved by direct substitution. Students will learn to recognize and handle indeterminate forms, apply algebraic manipulation techniques such as factoring and rationalization, and use the powerful Squeeze Theorem. Special attention is given to important trigonometric limits. After completing this chapter, students will have a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating limits algebraically, graphically, and numerically.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Indeterminate Form
2. Zero Over Zero Form
3. Infinity Over Infinity
4. Algebraic Limit Technique
5. Factoring for Limits
6. Rationalization
7. Complex Fractions
8. Squeeze Theorem
9. Special Trig Limits
10. Sin x Over x Limit
11. Limit of Composition
12. Limits from Graphs
13. Limits from Tables
14. Numerical Estimation
15. Infinite Limit
