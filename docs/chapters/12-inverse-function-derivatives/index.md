# Inverse Function Derivatives

## Summary

This chapter focuses on derivatives of inverse functions, particularly inverse trigonometric functions. Students will learn the derivatives of all six inverse trigonometric functions and understand their domain restrictions. The chapter also introduces logarithmic differentiation, a powerful technique for differentiating products, quotients, and functions with variable exponents. After completing this chapter, students will have mastered all derivative formulas needed for AP Calculus.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 12 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Graphical Inverse Deriv
2. Derivative of Arcsin
3. Derivative of Arccos
4. Derivative of Arctan
5. Derivative of Arcsec
6. Derivative of Arccsc
7. Derivative of Arccot
8. Inverse Trig Domain
9. Logarithmic Differentiate
10. Differentiating Products
11. Differentiating Powers
12. Variable Exponents

## Prerequisites
