# Derivative Tests and Concavity

## Summary

This chapter develops techniques for classifying critical points and analyzing function shape. Students will learn the first derivative test using sign charts to determine where functions increase or decrease and to classify local extrema. The second derivative test provides an alternative method using concavity. Students will also learn to find inflection points and use the candidates test for finding absolute extrema on closed intervals. After completing this chapter, students will be able to fully analyze function behavior using derivative information.
