# Quiz: Derivative Tests and Concavity

Test your understanding of derivative tests and concavity with these review questions.

#### 1. According to the First Derivative Test, a local maximum occurs at c if:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f'(c) > 0
2. f' changes from positive to negative at c
3. f' changes from negative to positive at c
4. f''(c) > 0
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The First Derivative Test says: if f' changes from positive to negative at c, then f has a local maximum at c. The function goes from increasing to decreasing.

    **Concept Tested:** First Derivative Test

#### 2. A function is increasing on an interval when:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f'(x) < 0 throughout the interval
2. f'(x) > 0 throughout the interval
3. f''(x) > 0 throughout the interval
4. f(x) > 0 throughout the interval
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A function is increasing where its derivative is positive. The positive derivative means the function values are getting larger as x increases.

    **Concept Tested:** Increasing Function

#### 3. A function is concave up on an interval when:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f'(x) > 0
2. f'(x) < 0
3. f''(x) > 0
4. f''(x) < 0
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A function is concave up where f''(x) > 0. The graph curves upward like a smile, and tangent lines lie below the curve.

    **Concept Tested:** Concave Up

---

#### 4. An inflection point occurs where:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f'(x) = 0
2. f''(x) = 0 or undefined, AND concavity changes
3. f(x) = 0
4. The function has a maximum
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An inflection point requires both that f''(x) = 0 or is undefined AND that concavity actually changes (from up to down or down to up) at that point.

    **Concept Tested:** Inflection Point

#### 5. According to the Second Derivative Test, if f'(c) = 0 and f''(c) > 0, then:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f has a local maximum at c
2. f has a local minimum at c
3. f has an inflection point at c
4. The test is inconclusive
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Second Derivative Test: if f'(c) = 0 and f''(c) > 0, then f has a local minimum at c. Positive second derivative means concave up (like a bowl).

    **Concept Tested:** Second Derivative Test

#### 6. For f(x) = x³ − 3x, find the interval(s) where f is decreasing.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. (−∞, −1)
2. (−1, 1)
3. (1, ∞)
4. (−∞, 0)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. f'(x) = 3x² − 3 = 3(x−1)(x+1). f' < 0 when −1 < x < 1, so f is decreasing on (−1, 1).

    **Concept Tested:** Decreasing Function

---

#### 7. A sign chart is used to:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Find where f(x) = 0
2. Determine where f' is positive or negative
3. Calculate the derivative
4. Graph the function exactly
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A sign chart shows where f' (or f'') is positive, negative, or zero across the domain. This reveals intervals of increase/decrease or concavity.

    **Concept Tested:** Sign Chart

#### 8. For f(x) = x⁴ − 4x³, find the inflection points.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x = 0 only
2. x = 2 only
3. x = 0 and x = 2
4. x = 0, x = 2, and x = 3
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. f'(x) = 4x³ − 12x², f''(x) = 12x² − 24x = 12x(x − 2). f'' = 0 at x = 0 and x = 2. Check that concavity changes at both points.

    **Concept Tested:** Point of Inflection

---

#### 9. If f''(c) = 0 in the Second Derivative Test, then:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f has a local maximum at c
2. f has a local minimum at c
3. f has an inflection point at c
4. The test is inconclusive; use First Derivative Test
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. When f''(c) = 0, the Second Derivative Test fails (inconclusive). You must use the First Derivative Test or examine the sign chart to classify the critical point.

    **Concept Tested:** Second Derivative Test

#### 10. A function that is both increasing and concave up has:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f' > 0 and f'' < 0
2. f' > 0 and f'' > 0
3. f' < 0 and f'' > 0
4. f' < 0 and f'' < 0
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Increasing means f' > 0, and concave up means f'' > 0. The function rises while curving upward—it's getting steeper.

    **Concept Tested:** Concavity
