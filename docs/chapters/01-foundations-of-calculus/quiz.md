Test your understanding of functions and their properties with these review questions.

#### 1. What is a function?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. An equation that can be graphed
2. A rule that assigns exactly one output to each input
3. Any mathematical expression with variables
4. A relationship where inputs can have multiple outputs
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A function is a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. This "one input, one output" property is what distinguishes functions from general relations. Option D describes a relation that is not a function.

    **Concept Tested:** Function

#### 2. The domain of a function is best described as:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. All possible output values
2. The highest and lowest points on the graph
3. All possible input values for which the function is defined
4. The x-intercepts of the graph
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The domain is the set of all possible input values for which the function is defined. Option A describes the range, not the domain. Understanding domain restrictions is essential for calculus operations.

    **Concept Tested:** Domain and Range

#### 3. If f(x) = x² and g(x) = x + 3, what is (f ∘ g)(x)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x² + 3
2. (x + 3)²
3. x² + x + 3
4. x² + 6x + 9
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The composition (f ∘ g)(x) means f(g(x)). First apply g to get x + 3, then apply f to get (x + 3)². Note that option D is the expanded form of option B, but B is the direct composition result.

    **Concept Tested:** Composite Function

#### 4. Which statement about inverse functions is correct?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Every function has an inverse function
2. The inverse of f(x) = x² is f⁻¹(x) = √x for all real numbers
3. If f(a) = b, then f⁻¹(b) = a
4. Inverse functions are always linear
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. By definition, if f(a) = b, then the inverse function satisfies f⁻¹(b) = a. Option A is false because only one-to-one functions have inverses. Option B requires domain restriction. Option D is false—many inverse functions are nonlinear.

    **Concept Tested:** Inverse Function

#### 5. A piecewise function is defined as f(x) = {x² if x < 0; 2x if x ≥ 0}. What is f(−2)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. −4
2. 4
3. −2
4. 0
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since −2 < 0, we use the first piece: f(−2) = (−2)² = 4. When evaluating piecewise functions, always check which condition the input satisfies before computing.

    **Concept Tested:** Piecewise Function

#### 6. The function f(x) = x³ is an example of:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. An even function because f(−x) = f(x)
2. An odd function because f(−x) = −f(x)
3. Neither even nor odd
4. Both even and odd
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. For f(x) = x³, we have f(−x) = (−x)³ = −x³ = −f(x), which is the definition of an odd function. Odd functions have origin symmetry, while even functions have y-axis symmetry.

    **Concept Tested:** Even and Odd Functions

#### 7. If f(x) = x², how does g(x) = (x − 3)² + 2 relate to f(x)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Shifted left 3 and down 2
2. Shifted right 3 and up 2
3. Shifted left 3 and up 2
4. Shifted right 3 and down 2
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The transformation (x − 3) shifts the graph right 3 units (subtract inside = shift right), and the +2 outside shifts it up 2 units. Understanding transformations helps predict function behavior without graphing.

    **Concept Tested:** Function Transformations

#### 8. What is the end behavior of a polynomial function with a positive leading coefficient and odd degree?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Both ends point upward
2. Both ends point downward
3. Left end down, right end up
4. Left end up, right end down
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. For odd-degree polynomials with positive leading coefficients, as x → −∞, f(x) → −∞, and as x → +∞, f(x) → +∞. This creates the "left down, right up" pattern typical of functions like f(x) = x³.

    **Concept Tested:** Polynomial Function

#### 9. What is one radian approximately equal to in degrees?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 45°
2. 57.3°
3. 90°
4. 180°
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since π radians = 180°, one radian = 180°/π ≈ 57.3°. Radian measure is essential in calculus because derivative formulas for trigonometric functions only work correctly in radians.

    **Concept Tested:** Radian Measure

#### 10. Which trigonometric identity is known as the Pythagorean identity?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)
2. sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1
3. tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)
4. cos(−x) = cos(x)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The identity sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1 is called the Pythagorean identity because it comes from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the unit circle. This identity is used constantly in calculus for simplifying expressions and solving integrals.
