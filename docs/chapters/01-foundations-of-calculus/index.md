# Foundations of Calculus

## Summary

This chapter establishes the essential prerequisite knowledge from precalculus that forms the foundation for all calculus concepts. Students will review functions and their properties, including domain, range, composition, and inverses. The chapter covers the major function families—polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric—along with graphing techniques and transformations. After completing this chapter, students will have a solid foundation for understanding limits and derivatives.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 20 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Function
2. Domain and Range
3. Function Notation
4. Composite Function
5. Inverse Function
6. Graphing Functions
7. Piecewise Function
8. Even and Odd Functions
9. Function Transformations
10. Polynomial Function
11. Rational Function
12. Exponential Function
13. Logarithmic Function
14. Trigonometric Function
15. Unit Circle
16. Radian Measure
17. Trigonometric Identities
18. Coordinate System
19. Number Line
20. Real Numbers

## Prerequisites

This chapter assumes only the prerequisites listed in the [course description](../../course-description.md), specifically:

- Algebra II (polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions)
- Precalculus or Trigonometry (trigonometric functions, identities, and equations)
- Functions and Graphs (domain, range, composition, and transformations)
