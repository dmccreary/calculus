# Implicit Differentiation

## Summary

This chapter introduces implicit differentiation, a technique for finding derivatives when y cannot be easily solved for as an explicit function of x. Students will learn to differentiate both sides of an equation with respect to x, treating y as an implicit function, and solve for dy/dx. The chapter also covers finding second derivatives implicitly and introduces the inverse function theorem. After completing this chapter, students will be able to find tangent lines to curves defined by implicit equations.
