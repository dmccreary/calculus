# Quiz: Curve Sketching

Test your understanding of curve sketching with these review questions.

#### 1. A complete curve analysis should include all of the following EXCEPT:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Domain and range
2. Intercepts and asymptotes
3. The exact area under the curve
4. Intervals of increase/decrease and concavity
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Curve sketching involves domain, intercepts, symmetry, asymptotes, first derivative analysis (increase/decrease, extrema), and second derivative analysis (concavity, inflection points). Area requires integration, not sketching.

#### 2. If f'(x) > 0 and f''(x) < 0, the graph is:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Increasing and concave up
2. Increasing and concave down
3. Decreasing and concave up
4. Decreasing and concave down
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. f' > 0 means increasing, f'' < 0 means concave down. The graph rises while curving downward—it's getting less steep as it rises.

    **Concept Tested:** f f' f''

#### 3. From a graph of f'(x), you can determine:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The exact values of f(x)
2. Where f is increasing or decreasing
3. The y-intercept of f
4. The area under f
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. From f', you can tell where f is increasing (f' > 0) or decreasing (f' < 0), and locate critical points (f' = 0). You cannot determine exact f values without more information.

    **Concept Tested:** Graph from Derivative

#### 4. If the graph of f' crosses the x-axis from positive to negative, f has:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A local minimum
2. A local maximum
3. An inflection point
4. A vertical asymptote
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. When f' goes from positive to negative, f goes from increasing to decreasing, indicating a local maximum. This is the First Derivative Test in graphical form.

#### 5. Which features should be plotted first when sketching a curve?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Random points on the curve
2. Intercepts, asymptotes, and critical points
3. The area under the curve
4. Only the maximum and minimum
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Start with key features: intercepts (where graph crosses axes), asymptotes (boundaries), and critical points (extrema). These provide the framework for the sketch.

    **Concept Tested:** Domain Analysis

#### 6. If f is an even function, its graph has symmetry about:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The x-axis
2. The y-axis
3. The origin
4. The line y = x
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Even functions satisfy f(−x) = f(x), meaning the graph is symmetric about the y-axis. You only need to analyze x ≥ 0 and reflect.

#### 7. An inflection point on f corresponds to what on f'?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A zero of f'
2. A maximum or minimum of f'
3. Where f' is undefined
4. Where f' crosses the x-axis
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An inflection point of f is where f'' = 0 or undefined and concavity changes. This corresponds to a local extremum of f' (where f'' = 0).

#### 8. For the function f(x) = x/(x² + 1), what is the horizontal asymptote?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. y = 1
2. y = 0
3. y = x
4. No horizontal asymptote
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. As x→±∞, f(x) = x/(x² + 1) ≈ x/x² = 1/x → 0. The degree of denominator exceeds the numerator, so y = 0 is the horizontal asymptote.

    **Concept Tested:** Asymptote Analysis

---

#### 9. The graph of f''(x) tells you about:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Where f is increasing or decreasing
2. The concavity of f
3. The y-intercept of f
4. The maximum value of f
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The sign of f'' determines concavity: f'' > 0 means f is concave up, f'' < 0 means concave down. Where f'' = 0 and changes sign indicates inflection points.

    **Concept Tested:** Concavity Analysis

---

#### 10. When analyzing local extrema, which analysis is most direct?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Find where f(x) = 0
2. Find where f'(x) = 0 or undefined, then test
3. Find where f''(x) = 0
4. Plot many points
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Local extrema occur at critical points where f'(x) = 0 or undefined. Then use First or Second Derivative Test to classify each as max, min, or neither.
