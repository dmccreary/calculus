# Curve Sketching

## Summary

This chapter synthesizes all derivative information to create complete curve sketches. Students will learn a systematic approach to analyzing functions that includes domain, intercepts, symmetry, asymptotes, intervals of increase/decrease, local extrema, concavity, and inflection points. The chapter emphasizes the connections between f, f', and f'' graphs and how to determine one from another. After completing this chapter, students will be able to sketch accurate graphs of functions using calculus techniques and analyze given graphs to extract derivative information.
