# Optimization

## Summary

This chapter applies derivative techniques to solve optimization problems—finding maximum or minimum values in real-world contexts. Students will learn to set up optimization problems by identifying the objective function to be optimized and constraint equations that limit the domain. Classic problems include maximizing area, minimizing cost, maximizing volume, and finding closest points. The chapter emphasizes verifying solutions and considering practical domain restrictions. After completing this chapter, students will be able to solve applied optimization problems systematically.
