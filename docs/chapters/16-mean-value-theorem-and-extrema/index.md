# Mean Value Theorem and Extrema

## Summary

This chapter introduces fundamental theorems connecting derivatives to function behavior. Students will learn the Mean Value Theorem and its special case, Rolle's Theorem, understanding the conditions required and their geometric interpretations. The Extreme Value Theorem guarantees extrema on closed intervals, and students will learn to distinguish between global and local extrema. The chapter also introduces critical points where derivatives equal zero or don't exist. After completing this chapter, students will understand the theoretical foundation for finding maximum and minimum values.
