# Quiz: Mean Value Theorem and Extrema

Test your understanding of the Mean Value Theorem and extrema with these review questions.

#### 1. The Mean Value Theorem requires a function to be:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Continuous on [a,b] only
2. Differentiable on (a,b) only
3. Continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b)
4. Differentiable everywhere
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The MVT requires two conditions: continuity on the closed interval [a,b] AND differentiability on the open interval (a,b). Both are necessary.

    **Concept Tested:** MVT Conditions

#### 2. The Mean Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a point c where:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f(c) = 0
2. f'(c) = 0
3. f'(c) = [f(b) − f(a)]/(b − a)
4. f(c) = [f(a) + f(b)]/2
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The MVT says there exists c in (a,b) where f'(c) equals the average rate of change over [a,b]. Geometrically, the tangent line is parallel to the secant line.

    **Concept Tested:** MVT Conclusion

#### 3. Rolle's Theorem is a special case of the MVT when:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f(a) = 0
2. f(b) = 0
3. f(a) = f(b)
4. f'(a) = f'(b)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Rolle's Theorem applies when f(a) = f(b). The conclusion is that f'(c) = 0 for some c in (a,b)—a horizontal tangent must exist somewhere between.

    **Concept Tested:** Rolle's Theorem

#### 4. The Extreme Value Theorem guarantees that a continuous function on [a,b]:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Has a derivative everywhere
2. Attains both a maximum and minimum value
3. Has a zero somewhere in (a,b)
4. Is differentiable on (a,b)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Extreme Value Theorem states that a continuous function on a closed interval must attain both a global maximum and a global minimum value on that interval.

    **Concept Tested:** Extreme Value Theorem

#### 5. A critical number of f(x) is a value c in the domain where:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f(c) = 0
2. f'(c) = 0 or f'(c) does not exist
3. f(c) is a maximum or minimum
4. f is continuous
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A critical number is where f'(c) = 0 or f'(c) does not exist (and c is in the domain). Critical numbers are candidates for local extrema.

    **Concept Tested:** Critical Number

---

#### 6. To find the absolute maximum of f(x) on [a,b], you should:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Find where f'(x) = 0 only
2. Evaluate f at critical numbers and endpoints, then compare
3. Find where f''(x) < 0
4. Graph the function
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Candidates Test: evaluate f at all critical numbers in [a,b] AND at the endpoints a and b. The largest value is the absolute maximum, smallest is the absolute minimum.

    **Concept Tested:** Candidates Test

---

#### 7. A local maximum can occur at x = c if:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f'(c) > 0
2. f'(c) < 0
3. f'(c) = 0 or f'(c) does not exist
4. f''(c) > 0
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Local extrema can only occur at critical points—where f'(c) = 0 or f'(c) doesn't exist. Not all critical points are extrema, but all local extrema are critical points.

    **Concept Tested:** Local Maximum

---

#### 8. Find all critical numbers of f(x) = x³ − 3x.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x = 0
2. x = 1
3. x = −1 and x = 1
4. x = 0, x = −1, and x = 1
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. f'(x) = 3x² − 3 = 3(x² − 1) = 3(x−1)(x+1). Setting f'(x) = 0: x = 1 or x = −1.

    **Concept Tested:** Where f' Zero

---

#### 9. The average rate of change of f(x) = x² from x = 1 to x = 5 is:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 4
2. 6
3. 8
4. 12
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Average rate = [f(5) − f(1)]/(5 − 1) = (25 − 1)/4 = 24/4 = 6. By MVT, f'(c) = 2c = 6 for some c, giving c = 3.

    **Concept Tested:** Average vs Instant MVT

---

#### 10. If f is continuous on [0, 4] with f(0) = 2 and f(4) = 10, the MVT guarantees:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f(c) = 6 for some c in (0, 4)
2. f'(c) = 2 for some c in (0, 4)
3. f(c) = 0 for some c in (0, 4)
4. f has a maximum at c = 2
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. MVT: f'(c) = [f(4) − f(0)]/(4 − 0) = (10 − 2)/4 = 2 for some c in (0, 4). The instantaneous rate equals the average rate somewhere.
