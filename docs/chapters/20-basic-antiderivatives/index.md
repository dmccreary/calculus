# Basic Antiderivatives

## Summary

This chapter introduces integration as the reverse of differentiation. Students will learn the concept of antiderivatives and indefinite integrals, including proper notation with the integral sign and constant of integration. The chapter covers basic integration rules that reverse the derivative rules: power rule, constant rule, sum/difference rules, and constant multiple rule. Basic trigonometric integrals are also introduced. After completing this chapter, students will be able to find antiderivatives of polynomial and simple trigonometric functions.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Antiderivative
2. Indefinite Integral
3. Integral Notation
4. Integrand
5. Variable of Integration
6. Constant of Integration
7. General Antiderivative
8. Particular Antideriv
9. Power Rule Integration
10. Constant Rule Integr
11. Sum Rule Integration
12. Difference Rule Integr
13. Constant Multiple Integ
14. Basic Trig Integrals
