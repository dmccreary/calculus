#### 1. An antiderivative of f(x) is a function F(x) such that:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. F(x) = f(x)
2. F'(x) = f(x)
3. F(x) = f'(x)
4. F'(x) = f'(x)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An antiderivative F(x) of f(x) satisfies F'(x) = f(x). Finding antiderivatives is the reverse process of differentiation.

    **Concept Tested:** Antiderivative

#### 2. The notation ∫f(x) dx represents:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The derivative of f
2. The definite integral
3. The indefinite integral (family of all antiderivatives)
4. The limit of f
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The indefinite integral ∫f(x) dx represents the family of all antiderivatives of f(x), differing by an arbitrary constant C.

    **Concept Tested:** Indefinite Integral

#### 3. Why do we add "+ C" to indefinite integrals?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. C stands for "calculus"
2. Functions differing by a constant have the same derivative
3. To make the answer positive
4. It's optional
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since the derivative of any constant is zero, there are infinitely many antiderivatives differing by a constant. The "+C" represents all of them.

    **Concept Tested:** Constant of Integration

#### 4. What is ∫x⁴ dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 4x³ + C
2. x⁵/5 + C
3. x⁵ + C
4. 5x⁵ + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Using the Power Rule for integration: ∫xⁿ dx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C. So ∫x⁴ dx = x⁵/5 + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Power Rule Integration

#### 5. What is ∫cos(x) dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. −sin(x) + C
2. sin(x) + C
3. cos(x) + C
4. −cos(x) + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since d/dx[sin(x)] = cos(x), the antiderivative of cos(x) is sin(x) + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Integral of Cos x

#### 6. What is ∫sin(x) dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. cos(x) + C
2. −cos(x) + C
3. sin(x) + C
4. −sin(x) + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since d/dx[−cos(x)] = sin(x), the antiderivative of sin(x) is −cos(x) + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Integral of Sin x

#### 7. What is ∫(3x² + 2x − 1) dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 6x + 2 + C
2. x³ + x² − x + C
3. 3x³ + 2x² − x + C
4. x³ + x² + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Integrate term by term: ∫3x² dx = x³, ∫2x dx = x², ∫(−1) dx = −x. Combined: x³ + x² − x + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Sum Rule Integration

#### 8. What is ∫5 dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 5
2. 5x + C
3. 0
4. C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The integral of a constant k is kx + C. Here, ∫5 dx = 5x + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Constant Rule Integration

#### 9. What is ∫sec²(x) dx?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. sec(x)tan(x) + C
2. tan(x) + C
3. −cot(x) + C
4. 2sec(x) + C
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Since d/dx[tan(x)] = sec²(x), the antiderivative of sec²(x) is tan(x) + C.

    **Concept Tested:** Integral of Sec Squared

#### 10. If F'(x) = f(x) and F(0) = 5, this type of problem is called:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A definite integral
2. An initial value problem
3. An optimization problem
4. A limit problem
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An initial value problem (IVP) gives a differential equation and a condition to determine the particular antiderivative. Here, find F(x), then use F(0) = 5 to find C.

    **Concept Tested:** Particular Antiderivative
