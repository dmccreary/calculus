# The Chain Rule

## Summary

This chapter introduces the chain rule, which enables differentiation of composite functions. Students will learn to identify the "inside" and "outside" functions, apply the chain rule formula, and handle nested compositions requiring multiple applications. The chapter covers applications to power functions, trigonometric compositions, exponential compositions, and logarithmic compositions. After completing this chapter, students will be able to differentiate any composite function by combining the chain rule with other derivative rules.
