# Related Rates and Linear Approximation

## Summary

This chapter covers two major applications of derivatives: related rates and linear approximation. Students will learn to set up and solve related rates problems by identifying relationships between changing quantities and using implicit differentiation. Classic problems include ladder, balloon, shadow, and conical tank scenarios. The chapter also covers linear approximation using tangent lines and introduces differentials. After completing this chapter, students will be able to solve real-world rate problems and approximate function values.
