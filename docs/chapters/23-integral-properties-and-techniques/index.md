# Integral Properties and Techniques

## Summary

This chapter covers properties of definite integrals and introduces integration techniques beyond basic formulas. Students will learn properties including additivity over intervals, reversing limits, and special properties for even and odd functions. The average value of a function and Mean Value Theorem for Integrals are introduced. The chapter then covers u-substitution, the most important integration technique, along with strategies using long division, completing the square, and partial fractions. After completing this chapter, students will have mastered the integration skills needed for AP Calculus.
