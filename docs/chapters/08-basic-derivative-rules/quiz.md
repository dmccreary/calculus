#### 1. What is the derivative of a constant function f(x) = 7?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 7
2. 1
3. 0
4. x
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The Constant Rule states that the derivative of any constant is zero. Since constants don't change, their rate of change is zero: d/dx[c] = 0.

    **Concept Tested:** Constant Rule

#### 2. Using the Power Rule, what is d/dx[x⁵]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 5x⁴
2. 5x⁵
3. x⁴
4. 4x⁵
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The Power Rule states d/dx[xⁿ] = nxⁿ⁻¹. For x⁵: d/dx[x⁵] = 5x⁴. Bring down the exponent and reduce it by one.

    **Concept Tested:** Power Rule Derivative

#### 3. What is d/dx[3x⁴ − 2x² + 5x − 1]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 12x³ − 4x + 5
2. 12x³ − 4x + 5 − 1
3. 3x³ − 2x + 5
4. 12x⁴ − 4x² + 5x
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Apply rules term by term: d/dx[3x⁴] = 12x³, d/dx[−2x²] = −4x, d/dx[5x] = 5, d/dx[−1] = 0. Sum: 12x³ − 4x + 5.

    **Concept Tested:** Polynomial Derivative

#### 4. What is the derivative of f(x) = x⁻³?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. −3x⁻⁴
2. −3x⁻²
3. 3x⁻⁴
4. −4x⁻³
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The Power Rule works for negative exponents: d/dx[x⁻³] = −3x⁻³⁻¹ = −3x⁻⁴. This can also be written as −3/x⁴.

    **Concept Tested:** Negative Exponent Derivative

#### 5. What is d/dx[√x]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 1/(2√x)
2. 2√x
3. 1/√x
4. √x/2
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Rewrite √x = x^(1/2), then apply the Power Rule: d/dx[x^(1/2)] = (1/2)x^(−1/2) = 1/(2√x).

    **Concept Tested:** Derivative of Root

---

#### 6. The Sum Rule for derivatives states that d/dx[f(x) + g(x)] equals:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f'(x) · g'(x)
2. f'(x) + g'(x)
3. f(x)g'(x) + g(x)f'(x)
4. [f'(x) + g'(x)]/(f(x) + g(x))
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Sum Rule states that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives: d/dx[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x). Derivatives are linear.

    **Concept Tested:** Sum Rule Derivative

#### 7. What is d/dx[5f(x)] if f'(x) = 2x?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 5f(x)
2. 10x
3. 2x
4. 5 + 2x
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Constant Multiple Rule states d/dx[cf(x)] = c·f'(x). So d/dx[5f(x)] = 5·f'(x) = 5·(2x) = 10x.

    **Concept Tested:** Constant Multiple Derivative

#### 8. What is the derivative of f(x) = 4x³ − 7x + 2?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 12x² − 7
2. 12x² − 7x
3. 4x² − 7
4. 12x³ − 7
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Using the Power Rule and Sum Rule: d/dx[4x³] = 12x², d/dx[−7x] = −7, d/dx[2] = 0. Combined: 12x² − 7.

    **Concept Tested:** Linear Combination

---

#### 9. What is d/dx[x^(3/2)]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. (3/2)x^(1/2)
2. (3/2)x^(5/2)
3. (1/2)x^(3/2)
4. (2/3)x^(1/2)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Apply the Power Rule with fractional exponent: d/dx[x^(3/2)] = (3/2)x^(3/2−1) = (3/2)x^(1/2) = (3/2)√x.

    **Concept Tested:** Fractional Exponent

#### 10. Find f'(2) if f(x) = x³ − 4x + 1.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 1
2. 5
3. 8
4. 12
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. First find f'(x) = 3x² − 4. Then evaluate at x = 2: f'(2) = 3(4) − 4 = 12 − 4 = 8.

    **Concept Tested:** Derivative of x to n
