# Basic Derivative Rules

## Summary

This chapter introduces the fundamental rules for computing derivatives without using the limit definition. Students will learn the constant rule, power rule, and the linearity properties (sum, difference, and constant multiple rules). These rules enable efficient differentiation of polynomial functions and expressions with negative and fractional exponents. After completing this chapter, students will be able to quickly differentiate polynomial functions and understand the foundation for more complex derivative rules.
