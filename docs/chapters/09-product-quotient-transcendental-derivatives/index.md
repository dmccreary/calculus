# Product, Quotient, and Transcendental Derivatives

## Summary

This chapter completes the toolkit of basic derivative rules by covering the quotient rule formula and derivatives of transcendental functions. Students will master the derivatives of all six trigonometric functions, exponential functions (both natural and general bases), and logarithmic functions. The chapter emphasizes strategies for combining multiple rules and simplifying expressions before differentiating. After completing this chapter, students will be able to differentiate any combination of elementary functions.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Quotient Rule Formula
2. Reciprocal Rule
3. Derivative of Sine
4. Derivative of Cosine
5. Derivative of Tangent
6. Derivative of Cotangent
7. Derivative of Secant
8. Derivative of Cosecant
9. Derivative of e to x
10. Derivative of a to x
11. Derivative of ln x
12. Derivative of log x
13. Combining Rules
14. Simplifying First
