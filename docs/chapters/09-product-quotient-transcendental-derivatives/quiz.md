#### 1. The Product Rule states that d/dx[f(x)g(x)] equals:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f'(x) · g'(x)
2. f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
3. f(x)g'(x) − f'(x)g(x)
4. [f(x)g(x)]'
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Product Rule: d/dx[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x). "Derivative of first times second, plus first times derivative of second."

    **Concept Tested:** Product Rule

#### 2. What is d/dx[x² · sin(x)]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 2x · cos(x)
2. 2x · sin(x) + x² · cos(x)
3. x² · cos(x)
4. 2x · cos(x) − x² · sin(x)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Using the Product Rule: d/dx[x²·sin(x)] = (2x)·sin(x) + x²·cos(x). Let f = x², g = sin(x), then f' = 2x, g' = cos(x).

#### 3. The Quotient Rule states that d/dx[f(x)/g(x)] equals:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f'(x)/g'(x)
2. [f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)]/[g(x)]²
3. [f'(x)g(x) − f(x)g'(x)]/[g(x)]²
4. [f(x)g'(x) − f'(x)g(x)]/[g(x)]²
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The Quotient Rule: d/dx[f/g] = [f'g − fg']/g². "Low d-high minus high d-low, over low squared."

    **Concept Tested:** Quotient Rule

#### 4. What is d/dx[sin(x)]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. −cos(x)
2. cos(x)
3. −sin(x)
4. tan(x)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The derivative of sine is cosine: d/dx[sin(x)] = cos(x). This is one of the fundamental trig derivatives that must be memorized.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. sin(x)
2. −sin(x)
3. cos(x)
4. −cos(x)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The derivative of cosine is negative sine: d/dx[cos(x)] = −sin(x). Notice the pattern: sine → cosine → −sine → −cosine → sine.

#### 6. What is d/dx[tan(x)]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. sec(x)
2. sec²(x)
3. cot(x)
4. −csc²(x)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The derivative of tangent is secant squared: d/dx[tan(x)] = sec²(x). This can be derived using the Quotient Rule on sin(x)/cos(x).

#### 7. What is d/dx[eˣ]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. xeˣ⁻¹
2. eˣ
3. eˣ⁻¹
4. ln(x)·eˣ
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The natural exponential function is its own derivative: d/dx[eˣ] = eˣ. This remarkable property makes e the natural base for calculus.

    **Concept Tested:** Derivative of e to x

#### 8. What is d/dx[ln(x)]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 1/x
2. ln(x)/x
3. x
4. eˣ
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The derivative of the natural logarithm is the reciprocal function: d/dx[ln(x)] = 1/x (for x > 0). This is essential for integration.

    **Concept Tested:** Derivative of ln x

#### 9. What is d/dx[x/sin(x)] using the Quotient Rule?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. cos(x)/sin²(x)
2. [sin(x) − x·cos(x)]/sin²(x)
3. 1/cos(x)
4. [sin(x) + x·cos(x)]/sin²(x)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Using the Quotient Rule with f = x, g = sin(x): d/dx[x/sin(x)] = [(1)·sin(x) − x·cos(x)]/sin²(x) = [sin(x) − x·cos(x)]/sin²(x).

    **Concept Tested:** Quotient Rule Formula

#### 10. What is d/dx[sec(x)]?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. sec(x)tan(x)
2. −sec(x)tan(x)
3. csc(x)cot(x)
4. sec²(x)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The derivative of secant is secant times tangent: d/dx[sec(x)] = sec(x)tan(x). This comes from the Quotient Rule applied to 1/cos(x).
