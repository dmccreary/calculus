# The Derivative Concept

## Summary

This chapter introduces the derivative, one of the two fundamental concepts of calculus. Students will understand the derivative as a measure of instantaneous rate of change and as the slope of a tangent line. Starting with average rate of change and the difference quotient, the chapter develops the limit definition of the derivative and introduces both prime notation and Leibniz notation. After completing this chapter, students will understand what the derivative represents both graphically and in terms of rates of change.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Rate of Change
2. Average Rate of Change
3. Instantaneous Rate
4. Difference Quotient
5. Secant Line
6. Tangent Line
7. Slope of Tangent
8. Derivative Definition
9. Limit Definition Deriv
10. Derivative at a Point
11. Derivative Function
12. Derivative Notation
