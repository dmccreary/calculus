# Quiz: The Derivative Concept

Test your understanding of derivatives and rates of change with these review questions.

#### 1. What does the derivative of a function represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The average rate of change over an interval
2. The instantaneous rate of change at a point
3. The area under the curve
4. The maximum value of the function
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change—how fast the function is changing at a specific moment. This is what distinguishes derivatives from average rates of change.

#### 2. Geometrically, the derivative at a point equals:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The y-intercept of the graph
2. The slope of the secant line
3. The slope of the tangent line
4. The area under the curve
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The derivative at a point equals the slope of the tangent line to the graph at that point. The tangent line touches the curve at exactly one point locally and shares its slope there.

#### 3. What is the average rate of change of f(x) = x² from x = 1 to x = 4?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 3
2. 5
3. 8
4. 15
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Average rate of change = [f(4) − f(1)]/(4 − 1) = (16 − 1)/3 = 15/3 = 5. This is the slope of the secant line connecting (1, 1) and (4, 16).

    **Concept Tested:** Average Rate of Change

#### 4. What is the limit definition of the derivative?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f'(x) = [f(b) − f(a)]/(b − a)
2. f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) − f(x)]/h
3. f'(x) = f(x+1) − f(x)
4. f'(x) = lim(x→∞) f(x)/x
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The derivative is defined as f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) − f(x)]/h, the limit of the difference quotient as the interval shrinks to zero. This captures the instantaneous rate of change.

#### 5. The expression [f(x+h) − f(x)]/h is called the:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Derivative
2. Secant slope
3. Difference quotient
4. All of the above
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The difference quotient [f(x+h) − f(x)]/h represents the slope of a secant line. When we take its limit as h→0, we get the derivative. It's the key expression in defining derivatives.

#### 6. Which notation represents the derivative of y with respect to x?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. dy/dx
2. f'(x)
3. Df
4. All of the above
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. All three notations represent the derivative: dy/dx (Leibniz notation), f'(x) (prime notation), and Df (operator notation). Different notations are useful in different contexts.

#### 7. If position is given by s(t), what does s'(t) represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Acceleration
2. Distance traveled
3. Velocity
4. Average speed
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The derivative of position with respect to time is velocity—the instantaneous rate of change of position. This is one of the most important physical interpretations of the derivative.

    **Concept Tested:** Instantaneous Velocity

#### 8. Using the limit definition, find f'(2) if f(x) = 3x + 1.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 1
2. 3
3. 6
4. 7
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. f'(x) = lim(h→0) [(3(x+h)+1) − (3x+1)]/h = lim(h→0) [3h]/h = 3. For linear functions, the derivative equals the slope, which is 3 everywhere.

    **Concept Tested:** Derivative at a Point

#### 9. The slope of the secant line through (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) represents:

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The derivative at a
2. The derivative at b
3. The average rate of change from a to b
4. The instantaneous rate of change
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The secant line connects two points on the curve, and its slope equals [f(b) − f(a)]/(b − a), the average rate of change over the interval. As the points get closer, the secant approaches the tangent.

    **Concept Tested:** Secant Line

#### 10. If f'(3) = −2, what does this tell us about f at x = 3?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f(3) = −2
2. The function is decreasing at x = 3
3. The function has a minimum at x = 3
4. The tangent line is horizontal at x = 3
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A negative derivative means the function is decreasing at that point—the tangent line has a negative slope. The function value is falling as x increases past 3.
