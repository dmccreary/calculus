# Asymptotes and End Behavior

## Summary

This chapter examines the behavior of functions as they approach infinity or as their values become unbounded. Students will learn to identify vertical, horizontal, and oblique asymptotes using limits. The chapter also covers end behavior analysis and compares growth rates of polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions. After completing this chapter, students will be able to describe the long-term behavior of functions and sketch graphs showing asymptotic behavior.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Asymptote
2. Vertical Asymptote
3. Horizontal Asymptote
4. Oblique Asymptote
5. Limit at Infinity
6. End Behavior
7. Behavior Near Asymptote
8. One-Sided Infinite Limit
9. Comparing Growth Rates
10. Dominant Term
11. Rational End Behavior
12. Exponential Growth Rate
13. Logarithmic Growth Rate
14. Polynomial Growth Rate
