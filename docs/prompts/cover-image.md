Visual elements to include as a subtle montage background:                                                     
- Calculus curves and function graphs (sine waves, parabolas, exponential curves)                              
- Derivative notation (dy/dx, f'(x)) floating subtly                                                           
- Integration symbols (∫) elegantly placed                                                                     
- Tangent lines touching curves                                                                                
- Area under curves (shaded regions)                                                                           
- Limit notation (lim as x approaches)

- Newton and Leibniz era scientific instruments subtly referenced                                              
- Abstract representations of motion and change                                                                
                                                                                                                 
  Color palette: Deep purple primary (matching MkDocs Material theme), with accents of gold, white, and soft     
  blue. Mathematical elements in lighter tones against darker background.                                        
                                                                                                                 
  Composition: Central focus area for title text overlay, with mathematical elements arranged in an aesthetically
   pleasing pattern around the edges. The design should feel dynamic yet balanced, representing the beauty of    
  calculus.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                    
  Mood: Intellectual, inspiring, accessible. Should appeal to high school and college students while conveying   
  mathematical sophistication.
