I am writing a course on calculus and I wanted to provide some historical context.  So I would like to create a timeline MicroSim using the vis-timeline javascript tools.  

Please generate a JSON file in the vis-timeline JSON format of 30 of the key historical events in the creation of Calculus.  Put the data in a file I can download.

For each event, create an event name (under 32 characters) - a detailed description for display on a infobox popup on hover over the event and a category group.  Include demographic statistics like N number of people take calculus in high school or college.
