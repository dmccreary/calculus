Many of the microsims use p5.js charts with a y axis label at the top that is overlapping the title and the subtitle.  Please      
  go through all the MicroSims and make sure these is adequate space below the title and subtitle so they do not overlap the the     
  y axis label.  Then come up with a precise rule for calculating the height of the drawing region so that this does not happen      
  again.  Place that new rule in the CLAUDE.md file so we can test it.
