## About This MicroSim

Drag the point on the blue curve to see how points on f(x) and f⁻¹(x) are reflections across the line y = x. Notice how (a, b) on f corresponds to (b, a) on the inverse!

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will compare a function and its inverse graphically, identifying the reflection relationship across y = x.

**Key Insight:** If (a, b) is on f(x), then (b, a) is on f⁻¹(x) - the coordinates swap!
