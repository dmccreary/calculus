## About This MicroSim

Click anywhere on the coordinate plane to place a point. The display shows the point's coordinates and which quadrant it's in. Use Quiz Mode to test your skills!

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will identify points in the coordinate plane and name the quadrant where each point lies.

**Activities:**
1. Place points in each quadrant and observe the sign patterns
2. Place points on the axes and discuss why they're not in any quadrant
3. Use Quiz Mode to practice coordinate identification
