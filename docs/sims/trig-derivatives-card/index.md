## Description

This interactive flashcard MicroSim helps students memorize the derivatives of all six trigonometric functions:

| Function | Derivative |
|----------|------------|
| sin(x) | cos(x) |
| cos(x) | -sin(x) |
| tan(x) | sec²(x) |
| cot(x) | -csc²(x) |
| sec(x) | sec(x)tan(x) |
| csc(x) | -csc(x)cot(x) |

The cards are arranged in pairs that share related patterns:

- **Pair 1**: sin/cos (co-functions)
- **Pair 2**: tan/cot (tangent family)
- **Pair 3**: sec/csc (secant family)

### Color Coding

- **Blue background**: Derivatives that are positive
- **Red background**: Derivatives that are negative (contain a minus sign)

This color pattern helps students remember the important rule: "co-functions have negative derivatives" (cos, cot, csc all have negative signs in their derivatives).

## Interactive Features

- **Click to flip**: Click any card to reveal its derivative
- **Quiz Mode**: Test yourself by typing the derivative before seeing the answer
- **Show All / Hide All**: Quickly reveal or hide all derivatives
- **Focus dropdown**: Select a specific function to study in isolation

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective

Students will recall the derivatives of all six trigonometric functions (Bloom Level 1: Remember).

### Grade Level

High School AP Calculus, College Calculus I

### Duration

10-15 minutes for initial practice, then 5 minutes daily for reinforcement

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of trigonometric functions
- Basic concept of derivatives

### Activities

#### Activity 1: Introduction (5 minutes)

1. Click through each card to see all six derivatives
2. Notice the patterns:
   - sin and cos are derivatives of each other (with sign change)
   - tan and sec are related (sec appears in both)
   - cot and csc are related (csc appears in both)
3. Observe the color coding: negative derivatives are on red cards

#### Activity 2: Pattern Recognition (5 minutes)

1. Use the "Show All" button to display all derivatives
2. Discuss with students:
   - Why do co-functions have negative derivatives?
   - What patterns do you notice in the secant/cosecant derivatives?
3. Use the focus dropdown to isolate each pair

#### Activity 3: Quiz Practice (10 minutes)

1. Click "Quiz Mode" to enter testing mode
2. Click a card to select it for testing
3. Type your answer and press Enter
4. Track your score and repeat until mastery

#### Activity 4: Daily Practice (5 minutes daily)

1. Open the MicroSim at the start of class
2. Complete one round of quiz mode
3. Aim for 6/6 correct within 30 seconds

### Assessment

- **Formative**: Quiz mode score tracking
- **Summative**: Timed quiz - identify all 6 derivatives in under 30 seconds

### Memory Tips to Share

1. **"Negative co-" rule**: cos, cot, csc all start with "co-" and all have negative derivatives
2. **sec/tan pattern**: sec(x) derivative contains both sec and tan; tan(x) derivative is sec²
3. **csc/cot pattern**: csc(x) derivative contains both csc and cot; cot(x) derivative is -csc²

!!! quote "Delta Moment"
    "These six derivatives are like a family! Once you see the patterns, you will never
    forget them. The 'co-' functions are the grumpy ones - they always bring a negative
    sign to the party."
