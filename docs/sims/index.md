## About MicroSims

MicroSims are lightweight, interactive educational simulations designed for browser-based learning. Each MicroSim:

- Focuses on a single learning objective
- Provides immediate visual feedback
- Works on any device with a modern browser
- Can be embedded in any webpage via iframe

All MicroSims in this course use open-source JavaScript libraries (primarily p5.js) so students can view the source code and learn from the implementations.

**Total MicroSims:** 123
