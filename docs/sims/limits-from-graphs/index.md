## About This MicroSim

Practice the essential skill of reading limits directly from graphs. This skill is critical for understanding limits conceptually and appears frequently on AP Calculus exams.

### What You'll Practice

- **Left-hand limits**: $\lim_{x \to c^-} f(x)$
- **Right-hand limits**: $\lim_{x \to c^+} f(x)$
- **Two-sided limits**: $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ (or DNE if one-sided limits differ)

### Graph Types by Difficulty

- **Basic**: Continuous functions (limit = function value)
- **Intermediate**: Holes (removable discontinuities)
- **Challenge**: Jump discontinuities and asymptotes

## How to Use

1. **Select Difficulty**: Choose Basic, Intermediate, or Challenge
2. **Analyze the Graph**: Look at behavior as x approaches the target
3. **Enter Limits**: Click each input box and type the limit value
4. **Check Your Work**: Get feedback on your answers
5. **Trace Points**: Hover over the graph to see exact coordinates

### Input Tips

- Click on an input box to select it
- Use Tab to move between inputs
- Type "DNE" for two-sided limits that don't exist
- Press Enter to check your answer

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

1. Determine limit values from graphical representations
2. Distinguish between function values and limit values
3. Identify when two-sided limits exist vs. when they don't exist

### Key Skills

When reading limits from graphs:
- Look at where the curve is **heading**, not where a point might be
- Check both sides for two-sided limits
- Open circles indicate holes (the limit may still exist!)
- Jump discontinuities mean the two-sided limit doesn't exist

### Suggested Activities

1. **Start with Basic**: Master continuous functions before moving to discontinuities
2. **Verbalize Your Process**: Say "as x approaches 2 from the left, y is heading toward..."
3. **Challenge Mode**: Can you get 5 challenge problems correct in a row?

### Assessment Questions

1. If you see an open circle at (3, 5) and a solid dot at (3, 2), what is $\lim_{x \to 3} f(x)$?
2. How can you tell from a graph that a two-sided limit doesn't exist?
3. What's the difference between $f(c)$ and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$?
