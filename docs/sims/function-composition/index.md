## About This MicroSim

Watch values flow through two function "machines" in sequence. The inner function g is applied first, then its output becomes the input to the outer function f. Use the Swap button to see how f∘g differs from g∘f!

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will explain how composite functions work by tracing values through two functions in sequence.

**Key Discovery:** Order matters! f(g(x)) is usually NOT the same as g(f(x)).
