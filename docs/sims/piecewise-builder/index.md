## About This MicroSim

Explore how piecewise functions combine different rules on different intervals. Notice the open (○) and closed (●) dots at boundaries - they show whether a point is included or excluded!

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will construct piecewise functions by defining different rules for different domains and observe the resulting graph.

**Key Insight:** A piecewise function is like a hiking trail with different terrains - one rule here, another rule there!
