## About This MicroSim

This interactive Venn diagram visualizes the important relationship between differentiability and continuity:

- **Differentiable functions** form a subset of continuous functions
- **Continuous but not differentiable** functions exist (corners, cusps)
- **Discontinuous functions** are always non-differentiable

### Key Concepts

| Statement | Truth Value |
|-----------|-------------|
| Differentiable ⟹ Continuous | TRUE |
| Continuous ⟹ Differentiable | FALSE |
| Not Continuous ⟹ Not Differentiable | TRUE |

### How to Use

1. **Click on regions** of the Venn diagram to see examples
2. **Hover over functions** to see their graphs
3. **Explore each category** to understand why functions belong there

### Learning Objectives

- Explain why differentiability implies continuity but not vice versa (Bloom Level 2: Understand)
- Classify functions by their differentiability and continuity properties
