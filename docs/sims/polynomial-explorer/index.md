## About This MicroSim

Adjust the degree and leading coefficient to see how polynomials behave:

- **Even degree + positive leading**: Both ends go UP
- **Even degree + negative leading**: Both ends go DOWN
- **Odd degree + positive leading**: Falls left, rises right
- **Odd degree + negative leading**: Rises left, falls right

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will examine how the degree and leading coefficient of a polynomial affect its shape and end behavior.

**Key Rule:** The degree tells you if the ends go the same direction (even) or opposite (odd). The leading coefficient tells you which way!
