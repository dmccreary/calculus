## About This MicroSim

Practice applying limit laws to evaluate limits algebraically. Problems range from basic single-rule applications to challenge problems requiring multiple limit laws.

### Limit Laws Covered

| Law | Formula |
|-----|---------|
| Constant | $\lim_{x \to c} k = k$ |
| Constant Multiple | $\lim_{x \to c} [k \cdot f(x)] = k \cdot \lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ |
| Sum | $\lim_{x \to c} [f + g] = \lim f + \lim g$ |
| Difference | $\lim_{x \to c} [f - g] = \lim f - \lim g$ |
| Product | $\lim_{x \to c} [f \cdot g] = \lim f \cdot \lim g$ |
| Quotient | $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f}{g} = \frac{\lim f}{\lim g}$ (if $\lim g \neq 0$) |
| Power | $\lim_{x \to c} [f]^n = [\lim f]^n$ |

## How to Use

1. **Select Difficulty**: Choose Basic, Intermediate, or Challenge
2. **Read the Problem**: See the limit expression to evaluate
3. **Type Your Answer**: Use keyboard to enter the numerical result
4. **Check Answer**: Get immediate feedback on your answer

### Difficulty Levels

- **Basic**: Single limit law (e.g., $\lim_{x \to 3} 5x$)
- **Intermediate**: Two laws combined (e.g., $\lim_{x \to 2} (x^2 + 3x)$)
- **Challenge**: Three or more laws including quotients

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

1. Apply limit laws to evaluate algebraic limits
2. Select the appropriate limit law for each term
3. Calculate limits of polynomial and rational expressions

### Suggested Activities

1. **Speed Drill**: See how many basic problems you can solve in 3 minutes
2. **Explain Your Reasoning**: For each problem, verbally state which law(s) you used
3. **Create Similar Problems**: Write your own limit problems for a partner

### Assessment Questions

1. Find $\lim_{x \to 4} (2x^2 - 3x + 1)$
2. Find $\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 3}$
3. Which limit law would you use first for $\lim_{x \to 1} (x + 2)(x - 3)$?
