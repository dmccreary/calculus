## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization helps students understand sigma notation (summation notation) by:

- Displaying the sigma notation with adjustable parameters
- Expanding sums term by term through step-through controls
- Showing visual blocks representing each term value
- Calculating running totals as terms are added

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

1. Interpret sigma notation and identify its components (upper limit, lower limit, index, general term)
2. Expand a summation into its individual terms
3. Calculate the value of finite sums
4. Connect the compact notation to the expanded form

### Activities

1. **Exploration (5 min)**: Have students adjust the upper limit and observe how the sum grows
2. **Pattern Recognition (5 min)**: Switch between different formula types and predict the sum before stepping through
3. **Practice (10 min)**: Given sigma notation on the board, use the MicroSim to verify calculations

### Assessment

Ask students to:
- Write the expansion of $\sum_{i=1}^{4} i^2$
- Calculate $\sum_{k=0}^{3} 2^k$ without the MicroSim, then verify
