## About This MicroSim

Watch the Pythagorean identity come to life! The areas of the green (cos²θ) and red (sin²θ) squares always add up to 1, no matter what angle you choose. This is because the hypotenuse of the reference triangle is always 1!

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will interpret the Pythagorean identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 geometrically using the unit circle.

**Key Insight:** The identity is just the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right triangle with hypotenuse 1!
