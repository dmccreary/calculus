## About This MicroSim

Move your mouse over the graph to trace the function. Watch how the function "blows up" near vertical asymptotes and approaches (but never reaches) horizontal asymptotes!

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will interpret the relationship between rational function formulas and their asymptotes.

**Key Insight:** Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero. The function gets infinitely large as it approaches from either side!
