## About This MicroSim

Transform the graph of y = A·sin(Bx + C) + D by adjusting each parameter:

- **A (Amplitude)**: Height of waves - how tall the peaks are
- **B (Frequency)**: How squished the waves are - period = 2π/B
- **C (Phase)**: Horizontal shift - slides the wave left/right
- **D (Vertical)**: Moves the midline up/down

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will demonstrate understanding of amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift by manipulating parameters and predicting resulting changes to trigonometric graphs.

**Challenge:** Can you create a wave that's twice as tall, half as wide, shifted up by 1?
