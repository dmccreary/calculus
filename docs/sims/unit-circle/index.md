## About This MicroSim

Drag the point around the unit circle or use the slider to explore how:

- The **x-coordinate** of the point equals **cos(θ)** (green)
- The **y-coordinate** of the point equals **sin(θ)** (red)
- Both values trace out their respective waves on the right

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will explain the relationship between angles on the unit circle and the values of sine and cosine, connecting circular motion to the graphs of trig functions.

**Key Insight:** Sine and cosine aren't just formulas - they're literally the coordinates of a point walking around a circle!
