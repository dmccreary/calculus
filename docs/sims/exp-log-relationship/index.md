## About This MicroSim

Drag a point on the exponential curve and see its reflection on the logarithmic curve. Notice how the coordinates swap - if (a, b) is on exp, then (b, a) is on log!

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will compare exponential and logarithmic functions, recognizing them as inverse functions reflected across y = x.

**Key Insight:** Exponential and log are inverses - they "undo" each other!
