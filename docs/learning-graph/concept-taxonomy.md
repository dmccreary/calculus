# AP Calculus Concept Taxonomy

This document defines the categorical taxonomy used to organize concepts in the learning graph.

## Taxonomy Categories

| TaxonomyID | Category Name | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| FOUND | Foundation Concepts | Prerequisites from precalculus: functions, trigonometry, coordinate systems |
| LIMIT | Limits | Limit concepts, notation, evaluation techniques, and theorems |
| CONT | Continuity | Continuity definitions, types of discontinuities, and continuity theorems |
| ASYM | Asymptotes | Vertical/horizontal asymptotes, limits at infinity, end behavior |
| DERIV | Derivative Basics | Derivative definition, notation, differentiability concepts |
| DRULE | Derivative Rules | Power, product, quotient rules and derivatives of elementary functions |
| CHAIN | Chain Rule | Chain rule and composition derivative techniques |
| IMPL | Implicit & Inverse | Implicit differentiation, inverse functions, logarithmic differentiation |
| HIGH | Higher Derivatives | Second and higher-order derivatives, motion applications |
| APPL | Applications | Related rates, linear approximation, L'Hospital's Rule |
| ANAL | Analysis | MVT, EVT, critical points, first/second derivative tests |
| CURV | Curve Sketching | Complete curve analysis using derivative information |
| OPT | Optimization | Setting up and solving optimization problems |
| INTEG | Integration Basics | Antiderivatives, indefinite integrals, basic integration rules |
| RIEM | Riemann Sums | Riemann sums, summation notation, definite integral definition |
| FTC | Fundamental Theorem | FTC parts 1 and 2, accumulation functions, integral properties |
| TECH | Integration Techniques | u-substitution, long division, completing the square |

## Distribution Guidelines

- Each category should contain approximately 5-8% of total concepts
- No single category should exceed 15% of total concepts
- Foundational concepts establish prerequisites
- Categories progress from basic to advanced within each major topic area
