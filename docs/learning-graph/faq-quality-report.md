## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Add questions for Curve Sketching concepts (currently 53% coverage)
2. Add more Evaluate-level questions (currently 3%, target 7%)
3. Expand Integration Techniques section

### Medium Priority
1. Add 2-3 more Create-level questions for Advanced Topics
2. Include additional examples in Technical Details answers (currently 27%)
3. Add questions covering BC-specific topics more thoroughly

### Low Priority
1. Consider adding a "Troubleshooting" subsection for common errors
2. Add questions about calculator usage on AP exam
3. Include questions about free-response problem strategies

## Suggested Additional Questions

Based on concept gaps, consider adding:

1. "How do I analyze a curve using derivatives?" (Curve Sketching)
2. "What is the first derivative test?" (Analytical)
3. "How do I find absolute extrema on a closed interval?" (Optimization)
4. "What integration techniques work for rational functions?" (Techniques)
5. "How do I determine if a series converges?" (Series - BC)
6. "What is the relationship between f, f', and f''?" (Curve Sketching)
7. "How do I evaluate definite integrals with substitution?" (Techniques)
8. "What is the role of endpoints in optimization?" (Optimization)
9. "How do I interpret the derivative in word problems?" (Applications)
10. "What are the conditions for the Extreme Value Theorem?" (Analytical)
