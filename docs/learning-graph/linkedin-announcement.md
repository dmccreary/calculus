Excited to share a new open educational resource: an interactive AP Calculus textbook designed for high school students seeking college credit!

This intelligent textbook covers both AP Calculus AB and BC curricula, built using
my state-of-the art Claude Code Skills. It features a learning graph showing concept dependencies, interactive MicroSims, and a fun mascot named Delta — a curious triangular robot who explores the hills and valleys of mathematical curves.

This is the most ambitious textbook I have generated!

By the numbers:
• 23 chapters covering limits, derivatives, integrals, and series
• 380 concepts organized in a dependency learning graph
• 123 interactive MicroSims (p5.js browser simulations)
• 230 quiz questions for self-assessment
• 230 glossary terms with ISO 11179-compliant definitions and examples
• Around 2,000 equations
• 72 frequently asked questions
• 231,000+ total words (~1,019 equivalent printed pages)

All content is free, open source, and runs in any browser — no expensive software required. Every student worldwide can fully participate regardless of their economic situation.  Every MicroSim can be
put in any website using a single iframe.

Generated using Claude AI skills and the intelligent textbook framework, this project demonstrates how AI can augment educational content creation while maintaining pedagogical rigor aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy.

I would love feedback from any of the 5 million people that take calculus every year around the world.
